## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize frisbee flight analysis through a sophisticated, instrumented disc platform. Our goal is to provide precision data for aerodynamics research, performance analysis, and biomechanical feedback, ultimately contributing to a journal/conference article.

* **Core Goal:** Instrument frisbee flight for precision aerodynamics research, performance analysis, and biomechanical feedback.
* **Disc Platform:** A modified regulation frisbee meticulously instrumented with sensor suite, logging, wifi, on/off, battery, LEDs.
* **Sensor Suite:** Integrated 9-DoF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and a BMP390 barometric pressure/temperature sensor, all managed by an onboard microcontroller. Optional GPS module support is planned.
* **Launch System:** A custom-designed cradle launcher adapted from baseball/softball cannon technology for consistent and controlled disc launches.
* **Primary Output:** Co-authored journal and/or conference articles based on research findings.
