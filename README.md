# Flatball Inertial Navigation System: Advanced Frisbee Flight Dynamics & Aerodynamics Research

## 🌀 Open Call: Help Us Decode Frisbee Flight

We’re building an open-source platform to analyze and visualize frisbee flight — from onboard IMU logging to 3D trajectory playback and CFD-backed airfoil modeling. If you’re into embedded systems, real-time sensor fusion, or just want to help frisbees fly smarter, this is your launchpad.
What’s in motion:
- 🛠️ Custom PCB for onboard IMU logging
- 🚀 Twin-motor frisbee launcher for repeatable flight studies
- 🌐 Three.js-based 3D visualization of flight trajectories
- 📜 Apache 2.0 licensing and reproducible workflows for contributors
We’re looking for:
- Embedded devs, PCB designers, and sensor wranglers
- Web-based visualization builders (Three.js, D3, etc.)
- CFD modelers and aerodynamic tinkerers
- Outreach-minded collaborators who care about open sports-tech
Why it matters:
Frisbee flight is beautiful, chaotic, and underexplored. We want to make flight analytics accessible — not just for researchers, but for athletes, makers, and curious minds everywhere.
Join us. Fork the repo. Open an issue. Let’s build something that flies.

You could drop this into your README.md, pin it as a GitHub issue, or even post it to relevant GitHub Discussions or open-source forums. Want help drafting a short contributor guide or a tweet-sized version for social sharing next?

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop a custom PCB mounted to a Discraft 175g Ultra-Star that logs:
  - 3DOF accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer
  - Barometric pressure, temperature, battery voltage
- Build a launcher capable of repeatable 6DOF launch conditions using twin e-bike hub motors
- Validate aerodynamic models across throw types (forehand, backhand, hammer, scoober)
- Simulate airfoil shape changes using CFD (OpenFOAM) and predict trajectory impacts
- Visualize flight data in 3D using Three.js and web-based tools

## 🧠 Skills We're Looking For
