# Contributing to Flatball INS

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Flatball INS — a multi-year, open-source effort to explore frisbee flight dynamics through embedded sensors, repeatable launch systems, and 3D visualization.

We welcome collaborators from all backgrounds, whether you're into embedded systems, aerospace modeling, visualization, or just love frisbee and physics.

## 🧠 Contribution Philosophy

This project values:

- **Empirical rigor** — contributions should be grounded in testable logic and reproducible workflows  
- **Readable outputs** — code, documentation, and data must be copy/paste-proof and batch-friendly  
- **Transparent reasoning** — calibration, axis conventions, and parametric relationships must be clearly documented  
- **Rapid iteration** — we expect fast feedback loops and error correction without drama  
- **Scalable design** — everything should be deployable across multiple discs, launchers, and environments

## 📜 Licensing Terms

By submitting a contribution, you agree to:

- License your work under the **Apache License 2.0**  
- Grant the project maintainers the right to relicense or publish derivative works, including scientific papers and datasets  
- Retain attribution and include a notice of modification in any changed files  
- Avoid submitting code or designs that you do not have the rights to share

## 📂 What You Can Contribute

- Firmware for sensor logging and calibration  
- Launcher control code and mechanical design improvements  
- Visualization tools (e.g., Three.js modules, trajectory playback)  
- Documentation, diagrams, and calibration workflows  
- Flight data logs and annotated test results  
- CFD simulations and aerodynamic modeling

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork  
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)  
3. Make your changes and commit with clear messages  
4. Submit a pull request with a description of your contribution  
5. Engage in review — we value clarity, reproducibility, and technical depth

## 📣 Communication

We use GitHub Issues and Discussions for technical dialogue. Please tag issues with `help wanted`, `good first issue`, or `calibration` as appropriate. You can also reach out via [project contact email or Discord link if applicable].
